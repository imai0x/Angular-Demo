# Project: The **Observable** Death Square

In the Galactic Empire, workplace safety and [a host of other issues](https://twitter.com/DeathStarPR) are very important to us. One thing we take very seriously is scalability. Unfortunately, `promises` are not very scalable. Enter: the `observable`. 

### Instructions:

1. Open up our data banks. Go into `turret-api` and run `seed.js` and `server.js` â€” don't forget to install those npm modules.

2. Go into `imperial-starfleet` and start up our front end.

3. Remove the `toPromise` import from your InfoWindowComponent.

4. Convert `findTurret()` to use `subscribe()` instead of `toPromise()` and `then()` as we showed in the last lesson.
