# Project: The **Observable** Death Square

In The Galactic Empire, workplace safety and [a host of other issues](https://twitter.com/DeathStarPR) are very important to us. One thing we take seriously is scalability. Unfortunately, `promises` are not very scalable. Enter: The `observable`.

### Instructions:

1) Open up our data banks. Navigate into `turret-api` and run `seed.js` and `server.js` â€” don't forget to install those `npm` modules!

2) Navigate into `imperial-starfleet` and start up our front end.

3) Remove the `toPromise` import from your `InfoWindowComponent`.

4) Convert `findTurret()` to use `subscribe()` instead of `toPromise()` and `then()`, like we demonstrated in the last lesson.
