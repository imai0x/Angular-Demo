# Vending Machine Kata: Drinking the ngCola?

## Introduction

In this exercise you will build the brains of a vending machine.  It will accept money, maintain
inventory, and dispense products.  All the things that you might expect a vending machine to accomplish.

The point of this kata is to provide a larger than trivial exercise that will enhance your understanding of Typescript and Angular 2.  A significant
portion of the effort will be in determining how to create your components and interact with the provided Angular services for managing communication across components and external API calls.

## Setup

Prerequisites: _@angular/cli_

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Install `json-server`:
```
npm install -g json-server
```

Start the API Server:
```
npm run api
```
NOTE: Data for the API server is found in `db.json` in the root project folder.

Start the app:
```
ng serve
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Features

As a professional software engineer, you will most likely be working off of stories. We have split the work of creating our vending machine into three user stories.

### Watch: Insert Coin

_As a vendor_  
_I want a vending machine that accepts coins_  
_So that I can collect money from the customer_ 

- The vending machine will accept valid coins (nickels, dimes, and quarters). Coins are represented by three buttons.
- When a valid coin is inserted (button pressed) the amount of the coin will be added to the current balance and the machine's display will be updated.
- When there are no coins inserted, the machine displays INSERT COIN.

### Code Together: Display Items

_As a vendor_  
_I want customers to see what they can buy_  
_So that I can give them an incentive to put money in the machine_

- The machine shows a list of items with their price and remaining inventory.
- List of items is populated from item.service, which uses the external API to return an array of item objects.

### Code Together: Select Item

_As a vendor_
_I want customers to be able to select an item_
_So that I know how much money to charge them and which item I should disperse_

- The machine includes a text input that accepts item codes.
- The text input should not accept more than two characters.
- The machine responds with "{{item.name}} selected." and selects item if user enters a code that matches an item code.

### Pair Lab: Dispense Item

_As a customer_  
_I want to be told whether my item has been dispensed_  
_So that I can know whether my transaction has been completed_  

- A button labeled 'Dispense' when pressed dispenses the selected item if there is enough current balance and the selected item has remaining stock.
- The machine responds with "No item selected" if the user has not yet selected an item.
- The machine responds with "Insufficient Balance" or "No Inventory Remaining," respectively if there is an error, and cancels dispensing of item.
- The machine responds with success message (developer's choice :) ) when item is successfully dispensed.
- The machine deducts item cost after successfully dispensing item.
