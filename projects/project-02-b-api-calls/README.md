# Project: The **Full Stack** Death Square

The rebel attack has begun!  At the moment, all our turrets are still operational, but some of them have taken damage.  We need to know which ones are in need of repair.  Luckily for us, this information is available to us in our data banks...we just need to bring it to our dashboard to quickly deploy repair droids.  To the data banks!

Spin up front end, spin up back end

Test in browser (look at one turret)

Import HTTP Module
