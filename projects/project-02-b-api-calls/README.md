# Pair Programming Project: The **Full Stack** Death Square

The rebel attack has begun. At the moment, all our turrets are still operational, but some may have been damaged. We need to know which ones need to be reapired. Luckily, this information is available in our data banks; we just need to bring it to our dashboard to quickly deploy repair droids. 

### Instructions:

1. Open up our data banks. Go into `turret-api` and run `seed.js` and `server.js` â€” don't forget to install the npm modules.

2. Go to `localhost:3000/api/turret/4` to see how much damage our fourth turret has. We have 16, so see how much damage the other ones have as well.

3. Go into `imperial-starfleet` and start up our front end.

4. Import HTTP into the InfoWindowComponent, as we did in the previous lesson. Also import the `rxjs` `toPromise` feature.

5. Put `http` into the constructor of InfoWindowComponent.

6. Create a `findTurret()` function that passes in a `turretNumber` that looks very similar to our `findCharacter()` function from the previous lesson. Make your `get` request to the same URL we used in step two.

6a. Save your JSON results from the `findTurret()` function in a variable called `dataBanks` (note: **not** `results` like the `findCharacter()` function). Make sure you declare `dataBanks` at the top of your `InfoWindowComponent` class first.

>**Note:** You want to `console.log()` the `response.json()` value before you save it to `dataBanks`. It does **NOT** have the same format as the Star Wars API response.

7. Call the function inside the `ngOnInit` function with a hardcoded value of `4`, for now.

8. Change the `info-window.html` template to an unordered list with two list items: One with a double bracket reference to `dataBanks.turretNumber` and one with a reference to `dataBanks.damage`.

9. Test your work so far in the browser.

10. In `death-square.component.html`, give each turret a `turretNumber` like so: `[turretNumber]="1"`.

11. Import the `Input` module from angular core in `turret.component.ts`.

12. Take this value into the `turret.component.ts` `TurretComponent` class like so: `@Input('turretNumber') turretNumber: number;`.

13.  Add the `turretNumber` variable in double curly braces to your `turret.component.html` template's RouterLink.

14. Add a `/:id` to the `info` path in `app-routing.module.ts`.

15. Now, we need to handle this new `turretNumber` in the InfoWindowComponent. Import `ActivatedRoute` and include it in your `constructor`, as we did in the URL Params lesson.

16. Add a `this.route.params.forEach` function and tuck the `this.findTurret()` function inside it, similar to the URL Params lesson. Don't forget to switch out the hard-coded `4` for the `param.id` coming from your route params.

17.  Now, let's test it in the browser. Click on the top-left turret. Two damage? Not too bad. Click on the bottom-right turret. Nine damage? Let's get that repair droid on its way.  

### Bonus

If you look in Dev Tools, you'll notice it complaining about `dataBanks` not being defined until we get the result back from our API. You can fix this with a well-placed [`*ngIf`](https://angular.io/guide/cheatsheet)\*.

\*Look for "Built-in Directives."
