# Project: The **Testable** Death Square

The rebels are on board our death square, and are heading for our datbanks!  A platoon of storm troopers has been sent to stop them, but we need to know the second they go offline so we can switch to a backup.  Let's do some TDD!

### Instructions:

1. Open up our data banks.  Go into `turret-api`, run `seed.js` and `server.js`...but don't forget to install those npm modules!

2. Go into `imperial-starfleet` and start up our front end.

3. Run `ng test` inside `imperial-starfleet`.  Nice, passing two tests.  But one failing test on InfoWindow!  Let's make it pass.

4. That failing test is complaining about `No provider for Http`.  What `Module` could we import to `info-window.component.spec.ts`?  Hint: it's towards the top of `app.module.ts`.  Don't forget to add it to an `imports` array below the `declarations` array in `TestBed.configureTestingModule`.  Save the file, and check the `ng test` browser output.

5. Woo hoo, we're failing again!  We need to import one more thing.  It's called `RouterTestingModule` and it comes from the `@angular/router/testing` package.  Don't forget to add it to the `imports` array, too.  Save the file, and check the `ng test` browser output one more time.

6. Create a new test below the 'should be created' one, and call it 'should have a findTurret function to get data from the data banks'.  Fail this test the old fashioned way, by making it test `expect(true).toEqual(false);`.

7. Let's actually test something now.  We're going to make a lot of changes to our Death Square Dashboardâ„¢, and we need to make sure that `findTurret` is still a working function.  Replace our `expect(true)...` expectation with `expect(typeof(component.findTurret)).toBe('function');`

8. Check your tests in Chrome one more time.  Once they are all passing, we know one more thing is safe from those blasted rebels!
