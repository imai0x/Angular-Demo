# The End? Not so fast!

We've almost reached the end of our course. You may not be Angular experts at this point, but you sure as heck know a lot more than you did at the start! But what exactly did we learn? It's time to pause and take inventory of all of the knowledge we've crammed into our brains over the past week.

## Exercise: Crowd-Sourced Study Guide

One student will volunteer to create a repository with one file named 'angular-cheat-sheet.md' and share the link with the rest of the class.
Students will then break out into teams and choose one topic from the following list:

- Typescript
- Angular CLI
- Components
- Services
- Modules
- Routing
- Promises & Observables
- Testing
- Service Workers
- Angular Universal

Each team will take 10 minutes to open up a pull request with an explanation of their topic and relative code examples (if necessary) to the document in the shared repository.

Once everyone is finished, we will go through the pull requests one by one, review them and merge them. In the end, you have have a crowd-sourced cheat sheet that you can refer to while kicking butt while working on Angular applications in the future!
