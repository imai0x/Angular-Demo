# Recap

### [What is a directive?](https://angular.io/guide/structural-directives)

- A **directive** is a marker on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) that tells Angular to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners like `click` or `change`), or even to transform the DOM element and its children.

> **TLDR:** It is a piece of HTML that allows you to do Javascript things.

### What is a promise?

- A **promise** is a method that eventually produces a value. If you'd like more promise recap, check out [this Google mammoth](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/getting-started/primers/promises) on oromises.

## Angular Punctuation

We've learned a lot of Angular punctuation this week.  Here is a quick review of what they all mean:

But sometimes we will see properties without the `[]`s around them.  What does that mean?  Well, if we have `[]`, we will evaluate the expression in Javascript.  If we don't, we will simply see the property as a string.  For example:
