# Routing Summary

You now can create a single-page application that allows the user to:

- Navigate to different parts of the application as if it were multiple pages.
- Bookmark and share different parts of the application as if it were multiple pages.

These types of pages can be:

1) Normal pages.
2) Pages that take URL parameters.
3) Pages with sub (child) routes.
