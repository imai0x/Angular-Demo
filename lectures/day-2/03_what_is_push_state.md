<!--WDI4 1:50 -->

# Lesson Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Describe `pushState()`.
- Demonstrate a single-page application that uses `pushState()`.

## Describe `pushState()`

- `pushState()` allows JavaScript to alter the browser's history as if a user was clicking on links and loading new pages.
- This gives the appearance that the user is actually visiting new pages.
- If the application is set up correctly, it allows deep linking so that users can bookmark and share links to specific aspects of an application as if it were a page itself.
- The user can use the browser's back/forward buttons to move back/forward through their history of the application's various states.
    - Now it behaves just as if they were viewing multiple pages of a traditional website.

## Demonstrate an SPA That Uses `pushState()`.
