## Describe Routing

- Routing is the process an app uses to mimic the feel of traditional navigation.
- The process:
    - Define a set of URLs for which the app will listen.
    - When a user visits those particular URLs, the app will load a component into a specific part of the page.

## Demonstrate Routing
<!--
Demo the site in [/router](/router). Show the following:

1) Click on the various links.
    - Note the nested links for `/about`.
    - Note the URL params for `/resume`.
2) Demonstrate sharing/bookmarking a URL.
    - Copy a URL like http://localhost:4200/links.
    - Close the browser.
    - Reopen the browser.
    - Paste the link into the URL bar.
    - Hit enter.
    - Note that it takes you directly to the "page" of the URL you copied. -->
