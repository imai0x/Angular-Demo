# Video: Quick Introduction to SPAs and PushState

## Lesson Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, students should be able to:*

- Define what a SPA is.
- List some advantages of a SPA over a traditional website.
- Describe PushState.

## Define What a SPA Is

- A **single-page application** (SPA) is a web application or web site that fits on a single web page with the goal of providing a faster, more intuitive user experience. In a SPA, either all of the necessary code — HTML, JavaScript, and CSS — is retrieved with a single page load or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary  (usually in response to user actions). 

(Show Facebook content loading as the user scrolls)

- The page does not reload at any point in the process, nor does control transfer to another page. Interaction with a single-page application often involves dynamic communication with the web server behind the scenes. 

(Show diagram of a web page with a button.  a cursor clicks on it.  an arrow labeled "request" is drawn between the page and a diagram of a web server.  an arrow labeled "data" is drawn from the web server back to the page.  a box with the word "data" appears in the diagram of the page)

## List Some Advantages of a SPA Over a Traditional Website

- Load time is slower up front, but faster with each interaction.
    - The server sends one large file up front, but then just sends tiny chunks of data to the user for each request rather than an entirely new page.
    - Making one request for a large file takes less time than making many requests to smaller files 
    (Show an animated race between two users.  One user downloads a file slowly at the beginning but then views many pages quickly after that.  At the same time, the other user downloads a file more quickly than the first user's initial page, but then downloads other pages at the same speed, which is slower than the first user's subsequent pages.  Very quickly, the first user should overtake the second one in terms of number of pages viewed.)
        -The HTTP request/response cycle is slow compared to the time it takes to download the response to the client computer
            - It's like moving. Would you take a bunch of small boxes out to the truck one by one, or would you stack them up and take a bunch all at once?
        - This lightens the amount of traffic to and from the server.
    - Users are usually willing to wait a little up front, but get impatient if they have to wait after each interaction.
- The server doesn't have to do as much work and therefore can be less powerful (and cheaper).
    - The client (browser) does the heavy lifting of rendering the site on the user's computer.
    - In traditional, server-side rendering, the server does the heavy lifting.
        - This isn't our best option because it requires one computer to do a lot of work for many users.
        - It's better to have many computers do this work on their own.
            - It's a great example of distributed computing.
            - Personal computers are now fast enough to handle this.
 
(Show drawing of two situations: one large computer with big arm muscles and $$$$ around it.  This computer has arrows out to many small computers. One small computer with thin arms and $ around it.  This computer has arrows out slightly larger than computers with $ around them.)

## Describe PushState

- PushState allows JavaScript to alter the browser's history as if a user is clicking on links and loading brand new pages.
- This gives the appearance that the user is actually visiting new pages. 
(show ESPN updating its URL as the user scrolls to a new article)
- If the application is set up correctly, it allows deep linking so that users can bookmark and share links to specific aspects of an application as if it were a page itself. 
(show a user sending a url to friends)
- The user can use the back/forward buttons of the browser to move back/forward through their history of the various states they've used of the application.
    - Now it behaves just as if the user were viewing multiple pages of a traditional site 
    (show a user visiting http://inside.chanel.com/en/chanel-by-karl, they click on "20. GABRIELLE, THE QUEST FOR FREEDOM" and then click the back button to show the page slides to reveal the previous page)
