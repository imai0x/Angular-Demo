## What we've learned so far

Over the past few days, we've taken a deep dive into the world of Angular. We've touched both the core Angular APIs and the satellite libraries that make using Angular much easier.

### Day One: Introduction to Angular

We started our first day by dipping our toes into Angular, but by the end of it, we were able to write our own applications from scratch! The Angular CLI played a big role in our work, as we learned how to use it to generate our scaffolding and serve our applications. Components were also a big focus of our work. We learned what a components is, why they are useful and how to write them in an Angular context. When our applications started becoming more complicated, we used Services to abstract out our business logic and keep our code dry. Finally, we rounded out the day by learning about Modules, and how they can keep our code organized.

### Day Two: Navigation and AJAX

Day two saw us pushing the boundaries of what our simple applications could do. We learned what a SPA was and how it differs from the traditional web application model. Next, we learned how to use the Angular Router to break our SPAs out into distict pages, and how to use push state to get these pages to play nicely with our browsers. 

Afterwards, we pushed the envelope even further by incorporating AJAX into our applications. We used Angular's Http service and our knowledge of URL paramaters to interact with an API and make our app more dyanmic.

### Day Three: Asynchronicity, Testing and Everything In Between

With the fundamentals down pat, we started filling in the cracks on day three. We covered Promises and Observables, exploring the strengths and weaknesses of using both to wrangle asynchronous behavior. Then we took a hard pivot into the world of testing, and explored the default testing setup that the Angular tooling provides us.

## Exercise: It's all coming back to you now

Let's make sure that everything we've covered so far sank in. Answer the following questions to the best of your ability.

1. What is a component and why do we use them?
2. What is a SPA? What are the advantages to using SPAs over more tradition web application paradigms?
3. What are the differences between Observables and Promises?
