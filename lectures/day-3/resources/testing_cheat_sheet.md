# Mocha Cheat Sheet

## Commonly Used Terms

* `describe`: a block that allows your code to be more readable and organized visually, allows you to discuss specific objects or methods

* `context`: a block that functionally behaves the same way as `describe`, but should be used when describing different situations or "contexts"

* `it`: a block that allows you to test methods on the subject that return a simple value.

* `beforeEach()`: a block of code that runs before each test inside of it

* `before()`: a block of code that runs only once, before all the tests inside of it have started

* `expectations`: begins with `expect(IUT).to`, or "Item Under Test"
