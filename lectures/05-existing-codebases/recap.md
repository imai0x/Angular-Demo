# The End? Not So Fast!

We've almost reached the end of our course. You may not be an Angular expert yet, but you definitely know a lot more than you did when we started. But what exactly did we learn? It's time to pause and take inventory of all of the knowledge you've gained over the past week.

## Exercise: Crowd-Sourced Study Guide

One student will volunteer to create a repository with one file named `angular-cheat-sheet.md` and share the link with the rest of the class.

Students will then break out into teams and choose one topic from the following list:

- TypeScript
- Angular CLI
- Components
- Services
- Modules
- Routing
- Promises & Observables
- Testing
- Service Workers
- Angular Universal

Each team will take 10 minutes to open up a pull request with an explanation of its topic and relative code examples (if necessary) to the document in the shared repository.

Once everyone is finished, we will go through the pull requests one by one, review them, and merge them. In the end, you'll have have a crowd-sourced cheat sheet that you can refer to while working on Angular applications in the future.
