# The End? Not So Fast!

We've almost reached the end of our course. You may not be an Angular expert yet, but you definitely know a lot more than you did when we started. But what exactly did we learn? It's time to pause and take inventory of all of the knowledge you've gained over the past week.

## Exercise: Crowd-Sourced Study Guide

Check out [this cheatsheet](https://github.com/den-materials/angular-cheat-sheet) from earlier students.  It has a basic rundown of the topics we've covered.

Per squad, choose one topic from the following list:

- TypeScript
- Angular CLI
- Components
- Services
- Modules
- Routing
- Promises & Observables
- Testing
- Service Workers

Each team will take 10 minutes to research a topic.  

When you have your results in one place, fork and clone [the cheatsheet repo](https://github.com/den-materials/angular-cheat-sheet) and add your changes to the README.

Push your changes up to your GitHub repo, and open up a pull request from your personal repo to the den-materials one with an explanation of its topic and relative code examples (if necessary).

Once everyone is finished, we will go through the pull requests one by one, review them, and merge them. In the end, you'll have a crowd-sourced cheat sheet that you can refer to while working on Angular applications in the future.
