## Lesson Objectives
*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*

- Describe Routing.
- Demonstrate Routing.

## Describe Routing

- Routing is the process an app uses to mimic the feel of traditional navigation.
- The process:
    - Define a set of URLs for which the app will listen.
    - When a user visits those particular URLs, the app will load a component into a specific part of the page.


It's great that HTML5 introduced new browser history mechanics to make it easier
  for us as developers to build Single Page Applications, and it's important to know what's going on under the hood.

However, on an important note - we're actually not going to
  be using these new features directly ourselves!

Instead, we'll use a tool called `RouterModule`, which bundles everything together so we don't have to worry about the fine print.

## Demonstrate Routing
<!--
Demo the site in [/router](/router). Show the following:

1) Click on the various links.
    - Note the nested links for `/about`.
    - Note the URL params for `/resume`.
2) Demonstrate sharing/bookmarking a URL.
    - Copy a URL like http://localhost:4200/links.
    - Close the browser.
    - Reopen the browser.
    - Paste the link into the URL bar.
    - Hit enter.
    - Note that it takes you directly to the "page" of the URL you copied. -->
