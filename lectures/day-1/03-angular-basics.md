# Angular Basics

![Angular Logo](http://mbtcheck.com/v2/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/angular.png)

**Angular** is a superior front-end framework. 

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Define the Angular CLI.
-   Download and install `@angular/cli` and scaffold a new Angular app.
-   Understand the basics of how an Angular app is composed.

## What is the Angular CLI?

The Angular command line interface (CLI) is a tool that allows us to serve up our Angular app, run tests, and generate code. In the recent past, we had to install our own web servers, set up our own testing and bundling infrastructure, and write all of our own code. Those days are behind us. The Angular CLI is a one-stop shop for all of the tools and tasks we need to build up our web app.

## Install `@angular/cli`


Let's install it globally:

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

To verify that everything is working, run the command `ng -v`. You should see a response that looks something like this:

```bash
@angular/cli: 1.2.7
node: 8.1.4
os: darwin x64
```

## From Nil to Angular App in Five Seconds

The Angular CLI let's us scaffold an application quickly and run it.

Type:

```bash
ng new ga-ui
```

Then let's move into the repository:

```bash
cd ga-ui
```

We should be able to run our web application immediately:

```bash
ng serve
```

## Angular Tools

Before we dive into the structure of the app, let's quickly cover all of the built-in tools Angular provides.

To run our app (and lint and watch):

```bash
ng serve
```

To run our unit tests:

```bash
ng test
```

To run our linter:

```bash
ng lint
```

There are a variety of other tools available, each with many, many configurations. To see a full list, type:

```bash
ng help
```

## Angular 2 Application Structure

Our scaffolded application looks like this:

```bash
├── README.md
├── node_modules
├── e2e
│   ├── app.e2e-spec.ts
│   ├── app.po.ts
│   └── tsconfig.e2e.json
├── karma.conf.js
├── package.json
├── protractor.conf.js
├── src
│   ├── app
│   │   ├── app.component.css
│   │   ├── app.component.html
│   │   ├── app.component.spec.ts
│   │   ├── app.component.ts
│   │   └── app.module.ts
│   ├── assets
│   ├── environments
│   │   ├── environment.prod.ts
│   │   └── environment.ts
│   ├── favicon.ico
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── main.ts
│   ├── polyfills.ts
│   ├── styles.css
│   ├── test.ts
│   ├── tsconfig.app.json
│   ├── tsconfig.spec.json
│   └── typings.d.ts
├── tsconfig.json
└── tslint.json
```

At the root of our application, we have a README, a folder for our end-to-end tests, the source folder where our code will live, and a series of configuration files. These configuration files relate to TypeScript and its linting. We won't be touching any files that live here or in the end-to-end folder.

In **src**, we'll find all of the files that are important to us and a few more configuration files we'll be ignoring.

We have our **index** that, like with most web frameworks, we'll leave largely untouched.

We have a few more TypeScript and test configuration files that suit us as is.

We have a polyfill file, which the Angular CLI supplies to ensure our code works well on all browsers.

We have **main.ts**, where our app is bootstrapped. This file is very important but works just fine as is.

And we have an app folder, which houses our first component. We'll take a deeper dive into this folder in a minute.

## Starting From Our Bootstraps

Let's take a look at **main.ts**:

```TypeScript
import { enableProdMode } from '@angular/core';
import { platformBrowserDynamic } from '@angular/platform-browser-dynamic';

import { AppModule } from './app/app.module';
import { environment } from './environments/environment';

if (environment.production) {
  enableProdMode();
}

platformBrowserDynamic().bootstrapModule(AppModule);
```

We have the modularity of Angular 2 on display here. We pluck a few modules from Angular 2 and **the component we generated**, and then bootstrap our module to make it the root of our application. Advanced Angular developers can tweak this bootstrapping process for their projects' specific requirements, but all we care about here is that the last line is where our component becomes an application.

## Our Root Component

At this point, you may be asking yourself "Where does the code that I write live?" For that, we turn to our root component — the app component in the app folder.

With **app.component.html**, we see our first Angular 2 template:

```html
  <h1>
    Welcome to {{title}}!
  </h1>
```

Notice that Angular uses a double bracket syntax to bind JavaScript expressions, which is the same as Ember and similar to Handlebars, if you've used either of those before. This will come in handy very soon.

The beating heart of our component exists in **app.component.ts**.

```typescript
@Component({
  selector: 'app-root',
  templateUrl: './app.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'app';
}
```

Our component's `selector` is the name of the HTML element we use to summon the component in our templates. If you look at our index, you'll see:

```html
<app-root></app-root>
```

Finally, our app component is neatly packaged up to be exported and then bootstrapped in **app.module.ts**.

```typescript
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { FormsModule } from '@angular/forms';
import { HttpModule } from '@angular/http';

import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

## Testing It Out

Browse to `http://localhost:4200` in your browser and see your default application.

Go into `app.component.ts` and change the `title` variable value to `My Website`.

Go back to your browser and you'll see your new title.

## Wrapping Up

By now, you should have a broad-yet-shallow understanding of how an Angular app is put together. We covered a lot of ground very quickly this lesson, so don't worry if you're not ready to remake Facebook in Angular just yet. In the coming lessons, we'll flesh out your understanding so you'll be ready to go out and conquer the world of front-end web development.
